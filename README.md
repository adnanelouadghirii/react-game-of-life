# React Game of Life

This project is a responsive implementation of Conway's Game of Life, built using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides an interactive grid where users can start, stop, clear, and randomize the game, which simulates cellular automaton behavior.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/adnanelouadghirii/react-game-of-life.git
cd react-game-of-life
npm install
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```
This will run the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and you may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### npm run eject

#### Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Project Features

- Responsive Design: The game layout adjusts for different screen sizes, ensuring a good user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Interactive Controls: Start, stop, clear, and randomize the game grid with easy-to-use buttons.
- Dynamic Grid: The game grid is rendered dynamically and updates in real-time based on the game's rules.
- Customizable: You can modify the grid size and the game's rules by adjusting the parameters in the code.
